Please note that self botting is against Discord's Terms of Service and being discovered <br>
using a self bot may result in your account being banned. To avoid this, keep knowledge of your self bot <br> to a minimum and use a throwaway account. I am not responsible for any accounts lost due to the self bot. <br> I also recommend checking the self bot channel's messages occasionally to see if Pok√©two has sent a captcha. <br> <b>If it has, it would be a good idea to solve it.</b> <br>
